            <h2>Analysis</h2>
            <p>The IT industry can be quite diverse from a career perspective as it branches out to many distinct and specialized fields, this trend of diversity can be observed via our team’s ideal jobs. There’s a plethora of similar and different aspects of our chosen career titles, for instance, when looking at our group’s ideal jobs, a majority of members are all IT related, the only exception is David with his being more catered to the field of analytical business, however that doesn’t mean David won’t need or use any of his set of IT related skills. Meanwhile the rest of the team’s areas of interest include cybersecurity (Budoor), programmer/developer (Dat and Benjamin) and IT administration (Richard). The required general and IT-related skills for our ideal jobs correlate with one another despite us having various job titles with different responsibilities and requirements. This is obviously due to the nature of the field of work that encompasses most if not all of team-member’s jobs, as one set of skills can often be applied differently to certain scenarios. An example of this is the fact that both Benjamin and I (Dat) are required to have experience and be efficient with JAVA even though our careers are branched off.</p>
