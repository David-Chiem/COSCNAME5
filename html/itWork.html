                <p><b>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</b></p>
                <p>The kind of work that is done by the IT professional is mainly customer service and troubleshooting with clients. They would deal with incoming tickets, such as software requests and hardware requests, such as provisioning new equipment such as laptops and monitors for people within the company. They would also handle the onboarding process for any new starters and also access requests for business applications. The IT professional would also help out with other side projects, with the current side project having to do with prepping the move to a new office.</p>
                <p><b>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</b></p>
                <p>All of the clients that the IT professional would interact with would be internal to the company. That means that the only people that they would interact with are either internal stakeholders or other staff members within the company. Some of the staff that they would work with are the HR team and the talent acquisition team. Working closely with those teams as they would handle the equipment for all new staff, sending in laptops, monitors, keyboards, mice, and being ready for them once they come into the office. They would also interact with other IT professionals within their own team, with the majority of the time working closely with the team, allocating roles to each member and helping each other out. The IT professional would also work with other teams, such as the security team, and the other tech teams within the company.</p>

                <p><b>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</b></p>
                <p>The most time consuming part of the IT professional’s job is dealing with helpdesk tickets which come in the form of access requests and hardware requests. As they work in a large company with about 15000 employees within the company they would have to deal with a lot of tickets on a daily basis dealing with requests to access both different programs and hardwares.</p>
                <p><b>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</b></p>
                <p>The most challenging part of their position is dealing with the hardware requests from the helpdesk tickets. During the lockdown it would be even harder to deal with troubleshooting with users that aren't tech savvy as you are a lot more limited in the ways that you can influence someone else's machine remotely. Also due to the company being an old company, there is a lot of tech debt that has to be dealt with at different times and is difficult to work through. Another challenging part of troubleshooting is the communication skills needed to get the client to give the answer that is needed or to ask the right questions in order to help them.</p>
